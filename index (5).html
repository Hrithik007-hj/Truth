  <p>Hello,My name is Hrithik Jasrapuria and I currently live in Bhagalpur, Bihar.I am writing this post as a last resort to get justice for all that I have to bear and as I am trying contemplating suicide due to atrocities by my family.
  <br><br>
     First of all, My paternal uncle(Chacha) verbally abused and blamed me and my mother blaming us for the death of my grandmother when I was 16 year old in 2015.He did that with full support of my father and my father's or my family.Nobody including my father or my uncle or any family member complained to any authority about it as they knew she died due to normal causes at the age of 65.
  <br><br>
      So,here their main motive was not that but to traumatize and destroy my whole future by not only abusing me and my  mother but also by completely disowning me from shop or house property gradually.
  <br><br>
     Yes,there was a mutual disrespect between my grandmother and my mother at the time of my grandmother's death but for this sole reason my father and uncle along with his family blamed me and my mother for the death of my grandmother by seeing it as a opportunity and kept me and mother in guilt for it by verbally harassing and abusing us so that all the ancestral property can be given to my uncle by my father.
  <br><br>
     This mutual disrespect and gatred also was first started by my grandmother along with my father,my uncle and bua towards my mothershortly after my parents marriage to which I got aware of as I got older.
  <br><br>
     The harassment continued for atleast 2 years after the death of my grandmother from 2012-2014 until one day when my uncle came home drunk and threatened to kill me and my mother if we don't give him shop and property all like he wanted.My father here fully supported his siblings(chacha & bua) and gave him all ancestral property which was the shop and house of our grandparents without even a single consent from me or my mother,so,which at that time it was made me to look like everything was happening in panic but in truth everything was pre planned by my father,his siblings and his/my family also.
  <br><br>
      But,now,Whenever I ask why he gave him the shop,he tells I gave him because I wanted to but according to law he didn't have the right to do so without my or my mother consent as it's a ancestral property and for the house,he tells that his share of money is with some person from whom he purchased a flat at Surat, Gujarat, the place where he forced me along with my mother to migrate in 2016 by telling that(ki mera mann nahi lag raha hai yaha)while leaving the family business at Bhagalpur to his brother and relatives in 2016 after the harassment was over as shop was transferred to my uncle from my father,but till now my father just gives me false promise for his/mine share of money from the sale of the house.
  <br><br>
    He still only loves and respects his brother and his other family members,and always belittle and hurts me whenever he wants to in ways like ex:- making me and my mother feel belittle at home,writing derogatory post about me on facebook etc especially he does this when I talks about the life he has given me at the expense of his brother or when i and my mother don't want to agree with him or his family for every right or wrong he says.
  <br><br>
   Further,nobody is coming up to support me in my motherâ€™s or father's family for the above problems,instead whenever I reason with them they starts lecturing and blaming me and tells me to obey my father by telling you can't do anything about it,like I am not a human being like them who deserved love and respect along with all the materialistic possession like the share of property which was mine for which at one point my uncle was ready to kill me for with full support of my father and his family.
  <br><br>
   I know all this trauma and mental harassment has made me weak which has affected me further as it was done continuously with my father and uncle and my family.
  <br><br>
   But,the thing is,if I can't even get justice for the things which are done wrong in the open, how can I think of getting help for the things done to me which are hidden.
  <br><br>
  So, basically I am now living in depression thinking about contemplating suicide all the time because of my father who only supported his brother his whole life even at the expense of his son,his son career,his son happiness and my mother.
  <br><br>
  Even,after doing all this deeds normally now he hates his brother in front of me but whenever he wants to piss me,he takes side of his brother to make me feel guilty because he thinks now I can't speak fight for myself or even at least can try to fight as he along with his family believes that i am only capable of suffering.
  <br><br>
  My father promised me that the inherited house property money which is approx 60 lakh will come on 1Jan 2025,whatever happens,now he promised it will come in 30 march,2025.But the thing is it's is with a guy named Anoop Agarwal before that it was with someone else,and before it was with someone else.Also it is with someone else since,10 years.
  <br><br>
 So,basically from 2015,I have not seen a single penny nor the flat which my father says that he had put the money into.It was 60 lakh in 2015 when he given this,and now it is supposed to be approx 95 lakh now,if even 6% of interest is calculated upon it.
  <br><br>
 So,right now I am seeing no hope towards anything in life as every door feels closed for me.When your own family betrays it doesn't feel good at all.
